The following is a glossary of key terms and concepts used in the Fast Flow Flywheel. If anything is unclear, please [reach out](/contact) to us.

| Term     | Description     |
|---------- |--------- |
| Evolution Trigger | Formalized signals or thresholds that indicate it may be time to **make or revisit a Flow Decision**. While *Flow Signals* surface everyday frictions, **Triggers reflect accumulated evidence or strategic shifts** that suggest your structure, interactions, or capabilities need to evolve. |
| Fast Flow | A state where value moves quickly and consistently through an organization, with minimal friction, clear ownership, and the ability to adapt without chaos. |
| Flow | The continuous, sustainable **movement of value** through a system, across teams, services, and decisions, toward a meaningful outcome. |
| Flow Clinic | A facilitated session where individuals or teams bring *flow-related challenges, trade-offs, or structural uncertainties* for collaborative exploration. Rather than prescribing answers, Flow Clinics create a space for advice-based decision-making, guided by shared principles and facilitated inquiry.|
| Flow Decision | A structured, intentional choice to evolve your team, service, or coordination model in pursuit of faster, safer delivery. It captures not just *what* you’re changing, but *why*, *how*, and *what impact you expect*. |
| Flow Decision Record | A short, structured artifact that captures a decision made to improve the flow of value in an organization. Like an [Architecture Decision Record](https://adr.github.io/), it emphasizes clarity, traceability, and accountability, but instead of focusing on technical architecture, it focuses on organizational dynamics, team interactions, and strategic alignment with flow. For more, see [Flow Decision Records](https://flowdecisionrecords.com). |
| Flow Friction | Friction in the flow of value, often manifesting as delays, misalignments, or hidden dependencies that slow down delivery and increase risk. |
| Flow Objective | Define what you’re aiming to improve or enable as you evolve your team and service structures. They provide a **north star for structural decisions**, helping teams and leaders align on what “better flow” really means. |
| Flow Outcome | A specific, observable improvements you aim to achieve by evolving your team structures, service boundaries, or enabling systems. They serve as **anchors for strategic intent** and provide a way to assess whether changes are working, not just structurally, but in terms of real-world impact on value delivery, autonomy, and decision-making. |
| Flow Play | A repeatable structural patterns or interventions designed to help teams and organizations **respond to flow friction**. Each Play connects one or more **Flow Signals** to a high-level **structural response**,  often informed by patterns from Team Topologies, Dynamic Reteaming, enabling teams, or fast flow principles. |
| Flow Roadmap | A structured plan for evolving your team and service structures to improve flow. It includes a series of *Flow Decisions* and *Flow Tactics* that together form a cohesive strategy for achieving a specific *Flow Outcome*. |
| Flow Signal | Short, recognizable statements that indicate **friction, misalignment, or emerging challenges** in the flow of value across your organization. They help surface problems early ,  before they escalate into delivery failures, missed opportunities, or reactive reorgs. |
| Flow Tactics | Specific, testable interventions that teams and leaders can use to improve flow, autonomy, decision-making, and alignment. Tactics are **situational building blocks**, often small, safe-to-try actions, that help operationalize larger structural changes described in *Flow Plays* or derived from *Flow Decisions*. |
| Strategic Bets | **Focused, high-leverage investments** you make to evolve your organization’s structure, capabilities, or coordination in pursuit of faster flow. Strategic Bets help you **focus energy and attention** on what really matters, while treating change as a testable experiment, not a guaranteed outcome.|
| Strategic Principles | Foundational beliefs that guide how we structure teams, design services, and evolve our organization for faster flow. They’re not rules, they’re compass points. |
