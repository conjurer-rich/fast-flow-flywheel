Between Q4 2024 and Q1 2025, two Fast Flow Flywheel facilitators, both experienced in organizational design and flow-centric transformation, partnered with Lumana, a fast-scaling European lifestyle brand operating across wellness, hospitality, and digital services (for the purposes of this example, Lumana is an organization based upon a real-world company - we'll replace this when we are able to obtain confirmation that we can use the original company as a public case study).

Lumana had grown quickly, but their internal structure hadn‚Äôt kept pace. Despite talented teams and high demand, delivery was lagging. Leaders were sensing friction but struggling to locate its source, and teams were operating in silos that no longer matched how value needed to flow.

Although the engagement wasn‚Äôt formally branded as a Flywheel engagement at the time, it followed the full Sense ‚Üí Act ‚Üí Reflect ‚Üí Align ‚Üí Amplify cycle, and offers a strong illustration of the Flywheel in practice.

## üß≠ Sense: Making Friction Visible

The first step was to surface the things that were slowing flow across Lumana‚Äôs digital and physical experience teams. Over a 3-day immersive workshop and a series of follow-on sessions, facilitators worked with product owners, service leads, and engineering managers to:

- Map real user needs using User Needs Mapping
- Visualize dependencies and tensions using Team Interaction Modelling
- Gather firsthand signals of cognitive load, handoff delays, and unclear ownership

Patterns began to emerge:

- Repeated friction during cross-team initiatives
- Overloaded domain experts spread too thin
- Teams duplicating efforts without realizing it
- A fragmented understanding of customer journeys

The Sense phase gave Lumana a shared language for friction, and revealed the structural causes behind everyday slowdowns.

## üîÑ Act: Taking Evolutionary Steps

With the flow friction signals clear and priorities surfaced, the next phase focused on practical steps to improve flow.

Instead of a top-down reorg, Lumana‚Äôs teams participated in collaborative co-design sessions to explore better team boundaries and interaction modes.

Key activities included:

- Identifying Fracture Planes based on cognitive load and capability focus
- Using Team Interaction Modelling to explore multiple ‚Äúfuture state‚Äù options
- Validating those options with Independent Service Heuristics
- Defining Team APIs and clarifying responsibilities between newly formed teams

By the end of this phase, Lumana had agreed on a set of Flow Decisions that realigned teams around capabilities with clearer ownership and fewer dependencies. The shift didn‚Äôt require a full restructure, just targeted, well-reasoned changes that teams co-created and committed to.

## üîÅ Reflect: Pausing to Learn

Six weeks after the changes were applied, the facilitation team returned for a Flow Clinic and reflection session.

Together, they asked:

- Were the decisions we made actually reducing friction?
- What new signals are emerging?
- Are teams experiencing fewer blockers and smoother handoffs?

The reflection surfaced both positive impacts, faster prioritization and less thrashing between teams, and new frictions around shared platform components that hadn‚Äôt been fully addressed.

This led to a mini-retrospective across several teams, updating the Flow Roadmap with new insights and decisions.

## üéØ Align: Connecting to Strategic Intent

As Lumana‚Äôs leadership team reviewed its strategic bets for 2025, particularly a push toward premium digital experiences, they recognized the need to align structure to strategy.

A joint Flow Objectives + Strategic Priorities session was run with execs, helping to:

- Clarify which customer outcomes were most critical in the next 6‚Äì12 months
- Map which teams were closest to those outcomes
- Identify where investment, autonomy, or realignment might unlock flow

This phase ensured that structural evolution wasn‚Äôt just tactical, it was clearly tied to strategic intent.

## üìà Amplify: Doubling Down on What Works

Finally, the Amplify phase focused on extending what had proven effective:

- A newly piloted Enabling Team was scaled to support shared platform needs
- Internal facilitators were trained to run lightweight Flow Clinics independently
- Flow Decisions were made more visible through a living Now / Next / Later Flow Roadmap
- Teams began capturing their own Flow Signals as part of regular retrospectives

With the flywheel now turning, Lumana is evolving with greater clarity and confidence. What began as a friction-sensing engagement has become an ongoing capability‚Äîbuilding toward a culture of structural learning and responsive delivery.
