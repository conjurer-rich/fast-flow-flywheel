![Curate a Flow Roadmap](/assets/images/faster-flow-practices/define-a-flow-roadmap.png){: width="400px" .align-center }

Test structural bets through safe-to-try experiments,not big-bang transformations.

## Why it matters

Good ideas die in the gap between decision and implementation. Acting incrementally reduces risk, builds confidence, and creates visible momentum.

## How to act

Every Flow Decision includes:

- A proposed *intervention* (What will we try?)
- A timeboxed *experiment* (How long will we test it?)
- A desired *outcome* (What should improve?)

These small changes compound. As experiments succeed, the flywheel spins faster.

## Tools that help

- **Flow Roadmap** – visualize decisions as a Now/Next/Later backlog
- **Flow Experiments** – structure and evaluate safe-to-try changes
- **Flow Metrics** – track the impact over time

Act your way into better structure.
