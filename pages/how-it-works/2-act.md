## Make visible bets and move

Fast flow organizations turn insights into action.
They move with intention, framing each action as a small, visible decision they can learn from.

Acting is about making decisions that are conscious, explicit, and shared.
It means framing changes as flow hypotheses that can be applied, evaluated, and evolved over time.

## How we Act

- Create Flow Decisions that clearly describe the intended change, the signals prompting it, and what outcomes we are seeking.
- Use the Advice Process to invite perspectives without slowing momentum.
- Place decisions on a Flow Roadmap to make work-in-progress visible and manage structural change incrementally.
- Act small first, optimize for decisions that are reversible or low-risk, especially when uncertainty is high.

## Why Act?

Sensing without action is just observation.

It is easy to fall into the trap of seeing the signs but feeling too uncertain, too busy, or too cautious to move.

But fast flow is not about reckless change, it is about intentional movement, small, visible steps that help the organization learn and adapt.

Acting does not mean rushing.

It means treating every decision as a bet, something we can try, learn from, and evolve.
It means making our structural decisions explicit, so we can reflect on them together later rather than guessing what happened.

Momentum matters.

When we act early and intentionally, we build the muscle memory of adaptation.
We stop letting change happen to us and start shaping it with purpose.

## Outcomes we are aiming for when we Act

- Minimize decision bottlenecks that delay structural evolution.
- Maximize learning by treating actions as experiments, not final answers.
- Increase clarity and commitment by making structural decisions explicit and visible.

Acting with intention is what keeps the flywheel moving.
Without action, sensing becomes observation without momentum.
