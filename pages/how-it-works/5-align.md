Connect team design with strategy. Ensure structural changes support your strategic bets.

## Why it matters

Even the best teams can't deliver if they’re not aligned with what the business needs. Structure is a means, not the end.

## What to align

- Team boundaries with value streams
- Capabilities with strategic priorities
- Internal platforms with evolving needs

We use **Flow-Aware Design** to ask: _Are we organized to achieve our outcomes?_

## Tools that help

- **Flow Strategy Principles** - how we think about change and improvement
- **Flow Objectives** – link team-level work to strategic intent
- **Flow Heuristics** – simple rules to guide design decisions
- **Flow Investment Areas** – where we need to invest to achieve our desiredoutcomes
- **Flow Strategic Bets** – high-level shoifts that guid structural evolution

Alignment isn’t static,it evolves as strategy shifts.
