Uncover the signals that flow is slowing down, value is getting stuck, or teams are struggling to deliver.

## Why it matters

Most organizations notice flow problems *after* they become visible in delivery metrics or morale. But by then, it's often too late to respond effectively. We need earlier detection.

## What to look for

We call these **Flow Signals**, early indicators that something is off:

- Misaligned team priorities
- Unclear ownership
- Repeated handoffs or coordination delays
- Mounting technical debt
- Low psychological safety

## Tools that help

- **Flow Signals Radar** – assess the health of your current structures
- **Flow Clinics** – facilitated sessions to surface signals across teams
- **Flow Tactics** – catalog of common signals and how to respond

Detecting the right signals sets the flywheel in motion.
