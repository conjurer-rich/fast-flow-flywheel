Help others sense, decide, and act faster. Build internal capability and confidence.

## Why it matters

Sustainable change requires more than tools,it requires people who can lead it. By amplifying others, you turn a single effort into an organizational capability.

## How to amplify

- Share Flow Decisions transparently
- Enable teams to self-diagnose and experiment
- Offer facilitation, not control

Think of leadership as a platform,something others can build on.

## Tools that help

- **Enabling Team Plays** – ways to support teams without creating dependency
- **Facilitator Guides** – run better Flow Clinics and Decision Reviews
- **Flow Playbooks** – reusable guidance for change agents

Amplify what’s working. Make flow contagious.
