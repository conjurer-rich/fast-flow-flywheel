Pause to learn. Did our decisions improve flow? What needs to evolve next?

## Why it matters

Without reflection, we can’t improve. We risk locking in changes that don’t serve us,or missing what actually worked.

## What to reflect on

- Did the experiment achieve the desired outcome?
- What surprised us,positively or negatively?
- What might we try next?

Reflection turns decisions into learning loops, not dead ends.

## Tools that help

- **Flow Retros** – structured reviews of Flow Decisions and their outcomes
- **Team Interaction Modelling** – visualize how interactions have shifted
- **Flow Journals** – document insights for future decisions

Reflection fuels momentum and maturity.
