Turn insights into intentional structural changes, without triggering a full-blown reorg.

## Why it matters

Too often, decisions about team boundaries, platforms, or ownership are made top-down or based on anecdote. We need a better way to reason about structure as a product of flow.

## What to decide

We capture key structural bets as **Flow Decisions**:

- Should this team split to reduce overload?
- Should we introduce a platform to simplify delivery?
- Are new capabilities needed to unblock value?

Each decision is explored using a facilitated **Advice Process** and captured for learning.

## Tools that help

- **Flow Decision Records (FDRs)** – simple templates to record the reasoning
- **Flow Decision Playbook** – practical guidance on common decisions
- **Flow Plays** – proven patterns that connect signals to decisions

Decide with clarity. Share the reasoning. Learn together
