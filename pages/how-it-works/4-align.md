## Check direction and tune connection

Fast flow organizations do not assume alignment is automatic or permanent.
They align intentionally and continuously, making sure team boundaries, interactions, and strategic priorities stay connected to reality.

Alignment is not a one-time event.
It is an ongoing conversation that keeps teams pointed in the same direction, even as conditions change.

## How we Align

Revisit Flow Objectives to check if outcomes and team focus areas are still aligned.

Map team interactions to uncover where dependencies, misalignments, or friction have emerged.

Use strategy principles and investment areas to ground discussions about trade-offs and priorities.

Refresh team boundaries or responsibilities based on new learning from sensing, acting, and reflecting.

## Why Align?

If we do not realign regularly, small drifts turn into big disconnects.

As organizations act and learn, things change.
Teams adapt, systems evolve, users shift their needs.
Without regular alignment, we risk pursuing outdated goals, duplicating effort, or creating unnecessary dependencies.

Alignment is how we stay intentionally connected to the flow of value.
It is how we create autonomy with purpose, not just independence for its own sake.

When we align openly and often, we strengthen trust, clarity, and collective momentum.

## Outcomes we are aiming for when we Align

- Increase clarity about current strategic priorities across all teams.
- Reduce misalignments between team goals and organizational outcomes.
- Increase autonomy by making shared context explicit and accessible.
- Increase transparency of team boundaries, responsibilities, and key interactions.
- Reduce time lost to cross-team conflicts, duplication, and miscommunication.
