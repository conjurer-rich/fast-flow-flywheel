## Reinforce what unlocks flow

Fast flow organizations do not just fix problems, they amplify what works.
They recognize that positive change needs fuel, celebration, storytelling, and deliberate scaling.

Amplifying is not about shouting the loudest.
It is about making enablers visible, reinforcing good practices, and helping momentum build across the organization.

What we amplify becomes part of our culture.

## How we Amplify

- Capture and share stories of successful flow improvements and structural evolutions.
- Identify and codify emerging patterns that others can reuse.
- Highlight and celebrate enabling behaviors, not just end results.
- Scale proven practices carefully, without forcing a one-size-fits-all solution.

## Why Amplify?

If we do not amplify progress, it fades into the noise.

It is easy to focus only on what is broken.
But without highlighting what is working, teams miss opportunities to build on success, replicate effective patterns, and feel the energy of forward movement.

Amplification is how change becomes self-sustaining.
It shifts the culture from reactive to proactive, from isolated wins to systemic improvements.

When we amplify wisely, we spread hope, momentum, and practical ways to unlock flow at every level.

## Outcomes we are aiming for when we Amplify

- Increase visibility of effective flow-enabling practices and decisions.
- Reduce reliance on top-down mandates by spreading organic adoption.
- Increase team engagement and belief in continuous improvement efforts.
- Increase sharing of successful structural experiments across teams and domains.
- Reduce resistance to change by highlighting real-world success stories.
