A Flywheel Rotation is a short, focused cycle that helps your organization move from stuck to flowing.

It helps you spot where value is getting delayed or teams are misaligned, then guide you through a lightweight process to uncover the root cause, take action, and learn what works.

It’s not a reorg. It’s not a workshop. It’s a structured way to build momentum, fast.

## Why it matters

Many organizations feel the symptoms:

- Delivery slows down
- Teams step on each other’s toes
- Priorities shift constantly

> Reorgs don’t solve the real issues

A Flywheel Rotation helps you step back, see what’s really going on, and make a focused, safe-to-try decision that improves flow. Each rotation builds learning and confidence, without disruption.

## How it works

The Fast Flow Flywheel rotates through five connected practices that help organizations sense tensions, respond with intention, and continuously evolve team structures to unlock flow.

This isn’t a one-time loop, it’s a living cycle of discovery, action, and alignment.

### 1. Sense

**Spot weak signals before they shout** - Tune into early signs of friction, misalignment, or opportunity. Use techniques like the Flow Signals Radar, feedback loops, and pattern recognition to uncover where change may be needed—before problems escalate.

### 2. Act

**Make visible bets and move** - Take action through explicit Flow Decisions. Whether it’s a small structural shift or a deeper team realignment, treat each change as a hypothesis. Use the advice process and Flow Decision Records to create clarity, reduce risk, and keep decisions transparent.

### 3. Reflect

**Learn what worked and what didn’t** - Evaluate the effects of each decision. Use Flow Clinics and retrospective techniques to surface insights, update what’s known, and refine your understanding of what enables fast flow in your context.

### 4. Align

**Check direction and tune connection** - Ensure that team boundaries, interactions, and strategic priorities remain in sync. Use Flow Objectives, strategic heuristics, and core domain insights to support shared direction and autonomous execution.

### 5. Amplify

**Reinforce what unlocks flow** - Spot what’s working and spread it. Codify practices, celebrate enablers, and tell compelling stories of change. Amplification fuels momentum and helps the flywheel keep spinning.

## What you get from one rotation

- Clarity on what’s slowing down flow
- A shared understanding of the constraint
- A safe, strategic action to address it
- Documented learning to guide what’s next
- A taste of what continuous org evolution can feel like

## Who it's for

Flywheel Rotations are designed for:

- Product and engineering leaders unsure what to fix next
- Teams who feel stuck, overloaded, or unclear on priorities
- Change agents looking for more momentum and less resistance

Whether you're just starting or already in motion, a rotation helps you build the habit of evolving,not just reacting.
