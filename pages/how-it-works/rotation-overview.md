## One Rotation. Real Progress.

A **Flywheel Rotation** is a short, focused cycle that helps you move from stuck to flowing, without disruption or drama.

Instead of launching a reorg or long transformation program, you take a structured, low-risk step:

- Spot where things are slowing down  
- Try a safe, targeted improvement  
- Reflect on what worked  
- Align around what matters  
- Scale what helps  

This is where strategy becomes structure, one smart move at a time.

## The Inner Loop: Five Steps to Unlock Flow

We use a five-step rhythm called the **SARAA Loop**.

Each rotation helps you turn friction into forward motion.

### 🔍 Sense

Surface signals from the teams closest to the work:  

- What’s slowing us down?  
- Where are we overloaded?  
- Are handoffs unclear?  
- Who owns what?

We use tools like **User Needs Mapping** and **Team Interaction Modelling** to make friction visible.

### ⚙️ Act

Co-design and test small changes to team structure, boundaries, or responsibilities.  
You don’t need a big plan, just a safe, well-informed next step.

Techniques include:

- Exploring feasible futures with **User Needs Mapping** and **Fracture Planes**
- Validating independent service candidates with **Independent Service Heuristics**
- Choosing appropriate Plays and Tactics to achieve desired outcomes
- Capturing **flow decisions** and building a **flow roadmap**
- Running **safe-to-fail experiments**

### 🔁 Reflect

Pause. Learn. Adjust.

After a few weeks, revisit the changes.  
Ask:

- What improved?
- What didn’t?
- What new friction are we seeing?

This step builds confidence and shared learning.

### 🎯 Align

Connect what you’ve learned to strategic goals.

Zoom out and ask:

- Are we closer to what matters?
- Do teams understand the bigger picture?
- Where should we focus next?

This keeps structure in sync with strategy, not just reactive fixes.

### 📈 Amplify

Scale what’s working.  
Support more teams.  
Make the decisions visible.

Craft internal playbooks that capture what works, and how to apply it.

You now have the ingredients of a living roadmap, one that evolves with your teams.

## Real-World Example: Lumana

Lumana, a fast-scaling lifestyle brand, used the Flywheel to:

- Identify overloaded teams and unclear handoffs  
- Redesign team responsibilities using Fracture Planes  
- Run small experiments to clarify ownership and reduce delays  
- Align their new structure to a strategic push toward digital experiences  
- Scale the practices that worked across other parts of the org

The result?  
Faster delivery, clearer ownership, and a growing internal capability to adapt.

## What You’ll Get from One Rotation

- ✅ Clarity on what’s slowing you down  
- ✅ A shared understanding of your constraints  
- ✅ A safe action to test a structural improvement  
- ✅ Clear learning and alignment  
- ✅ A starting point for an evolving roadmap

## Who Should Run a Rotation?

- **Product and platform leaders** sensing delivery friction  
- **Org designers and coaches** supporting structural evolution  
- **Change agents** looking for momentum, not mayhem

Whether you’re starting fresh or already mid-transformation, a rotation helps you take a confident next step.
