A SARAA Loop Rotation is a short, focused cycle that helps your organization move from stuck to flowing.

It helps you spot where value is getting delayed or teams are misaligned, then guide you through a lightweight process to uncover the root cause, take action, and learn what works.

It‚Äôs not a reorg. It‚Äôs not a workshop. It‚Äôs a structured way to build momentum, fast.

## Why it matters

Many organizations feel the symptoms:

- Delivery slows down
- Teams step on each other‚Äôs toes
- Priorities shift constantly

> Reorgs don‚Äôt solve the real issues

A SARAA Loop Rotation helps you step back, see what‚Äôs really going on, and make a focused, safe-to-try decision that improves flow. Each rotation builds learning and confidence, without disruption.

## How it works

The SARAA Loop rotates through five connected elements that help organizations sense tensions, respond with intention, and continuously evolve team structures to unlock flow.

This isn‚Äôt a one-time loop, it‚Äôs a living cycle of discovery, action, and alignment.

## What you get from one rotation

- Clarity on what‚Äôs slowing down flow
- A shared understanding of the constraint
- A safe, strategic action to address it
- Documented learning to guide what‚Äôs next
- A taste of what continuous org evolution can feel like

## üß™ A (Close to) Real-World Example: Flow in Motion at Lumana

Between Q4 2024 and Q1 2025, two Fast Flow Flywheel facilitators, both experienced in organizational design and flow-centric transformation, partnered with Lumana, a fast-scaling European lifestyle brand operating across wellness, hospitality, and digital services (for the purposes of this example, Lumana is an organization based upon a real-world company - we'll replace this when we are able to obtain confirmation that we can use the original company as a public case study).

Lumana had grown quickly, but their internal structure hadn‚Äôt kept pace. Despite talented teams and high demand, delivery was lagging. Leaders were sensing friction but struggling to locate its source, and teams were operating in silos that no longer matched how value needed to flow.

Although the engagement wasn‚Äôt formally branded as a Flywheel engagement at the time, it followed the full Sense ‚Üí Act ‚Üí Reflect ‚Üí Align ‚Üí Amplify cycle, and offers a strong illustration of the Flywheel in practice.

## üß≠ Sense: Making Friction Visible

The first step was to surface the things that were slowing flow across Lumana‚Äôs digital and physical experience teams. Over a 3-day immersive workshop and a series of follow-on sessions, facilitators worked with product owners, service leads, and engineering managers to:

- Map real user needs using User Needs Mapping
- Visualize dependencies and tensions using Team Interaction Modelling
- Gather firsthand signals of cognitive load, handoff delays, and unclear ownership

Patterns began to emerge:

- Repeated friction during cross-team initiatives
- Overloaded domain experts spread too thin
- Teams duplicating efforts without realizing it
- A fragmented understanding of customer journeys

The Sense phase gave Lumana a shared language for friction, and revealed the structural causes behind everyday slowdowns.

## üîÑ Act: Taking Evolutionary Steps

With the flow friction signals clear and priorities surfaced, the next phase focused on practical steps to improve flow.

Instead of a top-down reorg, Lumana‚Äôs teams participated in collaborative co-design sessions to explore better team boundaries and interaction modes.

Key activities included:

- Identifying Fracture Planes based on cognitive load and capability focus
- Using Team Interaction Modelling to explore multiple ‚Äúfuture state‚Äù options
- Validating those options with Independent Service Heuristics
- Defining Team APIs and clarifying responsibilities between newly formed teams

By the end of this phase, Lumana had agreed on a set of Flow Decisions that realigned teams around capabilities with clearer ownership and fewer dependencies. The shift didn‚Äôt require a full restructure, just targeted, well-reasoned changes that teams co-created and committed to.

## üîÅ Reflect: Pausing to Learn

Six weeks after the changes were applied, the facilitation team returned for a Flow Clinic and reflection session.

Together, they asked:

- Were the decisions we made actually reducing friction?
- What new signals are emerging?
- Are teams experiencing fewer blockers and smoother handoffs?

The reflection surfaced both positive impacts, faster prioritization and less thrashing between teams, and new frictions around shared platform components that hadn‚Äôt been fully addressed.

This led to a mini-retrospective across several teams, updating the Flow Roadmap with new insights and decisions.

## üéØ Align: Connecting to Strategic Intent

As Lumana‚Äôs leadership team reviewed its strategic bets for 2025, particularly a push toward premium digital experiences, they recognized the need to align structure to strategy.

A joint Flow Objectives + Strategic Priorities session was run with execs, helping to:

- Clarify which customer outcomes were most critical in the next 6‚Äì12 months
- Map which teams were closest to those outcomes
- Identify where investment, autonomy, or realignment might unlock flow

This phase ensured that structural evolution wasn‚Äôt just tactical, it was clearly tied to strategic intent.

## üìà Amplify: Doubling Down on What Works

Finally, the Amplify phase focused on extending what had proven effective:

- A newly piloted Enabling Team was scaled to support shared platform needs
- Internal facilitators were trained to run lightweight Flow Clinics independently
- Flow Decisions were made more visible through a living Now / Next / Later Flow Roadmap
- Teams began capturing their own Flow Signals as part of regular retrospectives

With the flywheel now turning, Lumana is evolving with greater clarity and confidence. What began as a friction-sensing engagement has become an ongoing capability‚Äîbuilding toward a culture of structural learning and responsive delivery.

## A Real World Example: Kickstarting Blue Lagoon's Fast Flow Flywheel

![Blue Lagoon Fast Flow Flywheel](/assets/images/customers/blue-lagoon.png){: .align-center }

Between October 2024 and January 2025, as part of an engagement with the core team at [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/), [Rich Allen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardallen/) and colleague [Erica Engelen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericaengelen/) (both [Team Topologies Valued Practitioners](https://teamtopologies.com/ttvp)), worked with Blue Lagoon, a fast-growing Icelandic wellness brand, to lay the foundations for a more adaptive, flow-oriented organization. Although the initial engagement was not framed as a Fast Flow Flywheel engagement, the approach they took captures the essence of the Sense and Act phases.

üß≠ Sense: Making Friction Visible

The engagement began by helping Blue Lagoon sense what was slowing their flow of value. Through an intensive 3-day on-site workshop and a series of Enable & Elevate sessions, we surfaced:

- Repeated coordination pain between teams  
- Unclear ownership boundaries
- Cognitive overload in critical roles
- Fragmented understanding of user needs

They introduced Team Topologies core principles and used techniques like [User Needs Mapping](https://www.teamtopologies.com/unm) and [Team Interaction Modelling](https://www.teamtopologies.com/tim) to give leaders and teams a clearer picture of how work was really flowing, and where it wasn‚Äôt.

‚öôÔ∏è Act: Taking Structural Steps

Once key signals were visible, they supported Blue Lagoon in acting on them. Teams co-designed and validated new boundaries using:

- Fracture Planes to brainstorm and explore potential ownership boundaries
- Team Interaction Modelling to explore feasible futures
- [Independent Service Heuristics](https://teamtopologies.com/ish) to assess viability of team structure options
- Lightweight evolution tactics like defining Team APIs to reduce overload and clarify responsibilities

This resulted in a set of Flow Decisions to define target team structures that better aligned with value delivery and were achievable without needing a full re-org. They left Blue Lagoon having built shared language and momentum for change.

üîÑ What‚Äôs Next: Reflect, Align, Amplify

Alongside the engagement, Blue Lagoon's C-Level executive team were exploring their strategic intent and direction for the coming year (essentially the outer OODA Loop of the Fast Flow Flywheel). Later this year, they hope to return to support the next phases:

- **Reflect:** Did the changes have the intended effect? What new signals are emerging?
- **Align:** How do they connect structural evolution to evolving strategy?
- **Amplify:** Which practices, platforms, or plays should they double down on?

By revisiting the flywheel together, they‚Äôll seek to help Blue Lagoon evolve with intent, scaling what works, sensing what‚Äôs shifting, and aligning teams around what matters most.
