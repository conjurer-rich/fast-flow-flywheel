A Flywheel Rotation is a short, focused cycle that helps your organization move from stuck to flowing.

We help you spot where value is getting delayed or teams are misaligned, then guide you through a lightweight process to uncover the root cause, take action, and learn what works.

It’s not a reorg. It’s not a workshop. It’s a structured way to build momentum—fast.

## Why it matters

Many organizations feel the symptoms:

- Delivery slows down
- Teams step on each other’s toes
- Priorities shift constantly

> Reorgs don’t solve the real issues

A Flywheel Rotation helps you step back, see what’s really going on, and make a focused, safe-to-try decision that improves flow. Each rotation builds learning and confidence—without disruption.

## How it works

We guide your team through five connected steps:

**1. Detect** Spot the early warning signs—what we call flow signals—that something isn’t working.

**2. Decide** Turn those signals into a clear, documented Flow Decision—a focused action worth trying.

**3. Act** Run a lightweight intervention (like a mapping session or targeted play) to test the decision.

**4. Reflect** Hold a short review—what worked, what didn’t, and what we learned.

**5. Align** Feed the learning into your Flow Roadmap so future changes are better informed.

## What you get from one rotation

- Clarity on what’s slowing down flow
- A shared understanding of the constraint
- A safe, strategic action to address it
- Documented learning to guide what’s next
- A taste of what continuous org evolution can feel like

## Who it's for

Flywheel Rotations are designed for:

- Product and engineering leaders unsure what to fix next
- Teams who feel stuck, overloaded, or unclear on priorities
- Change agents looking for more momentum and less resistance

Whether you're just starting or already in motion, a rotation helps you build the habit of evolving—not just reacting.
