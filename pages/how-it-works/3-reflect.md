## Learn what worked and what didn’t

Fast flow organizations treat every action as a learning opportunity.
They reflect not just to celebrate or critique, but to deepen their understanding of how flow emerges and where it gets stuck.

Reflection turns invisible patterns into visible insights.
It helps us spot unintended consequences, unexpected wins, and opportunities to adjust course before small issues become major blockers.

## How we Reflect

Use Flow Clinics to revisit recent decisions and structural experiments together.

Surface what changed, what stayed stuck, and what new tensions appeared.

Focus reflection on learning, not blame—create safety to name what did not work.

Update Flow Roadmaps and Flow Decision Records with real-world insights.

## Why Reflect?

Without reflection, we just stack actions without understanding.

It is easy to confuse movement with progress.
But if we never stop to ask, What actually happened? or What surprised us?, we miss the signals that could guide better next steps.

Reflection gives flow decisions a feedback loop.
It turns one-off bets into cumulative learning.
It shifts the culture from "fix and forget" to "sense, act, and evolve."

When we reflect openly and regularly, we do not just adapt faster, we build shared intelligence across the organization.

## Outcomes we are aiming for when we Reflect

- Increase the number of flow decisions reviewed and updated based on real outcomes.
- Reduce the lag between taking action and integrating new learnings.
- Increase the number of structural insights captured and shared across teams.
- Increase psychological safety in admitting when actions had unexpected results.
- Reduce repeated mistakes by making invisible patterns visible and actionable.
