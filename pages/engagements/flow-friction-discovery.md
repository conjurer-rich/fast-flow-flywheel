## üß≠ Flow Friction Discovery Workshop

One day to see clearly where flow is breaking down‚Äîso you can act with confidence.

The Flow Friction Discovery workshop is a fast, focused diagnostic designed to surface hidden blockers, dependencies, and structural misalignments that slow down the flow of change and value across your teams. In just one day, we help you and your stakeholders build a shared, actionable understanding of where friction exists and what to do next.

If you are seeing symptoms like delivery delays, unclear ownership, coordination overhead, or misaligned priorities‚Äîbut cannot pinpoint the root causes‚Äîthis workshop will give you the clarity you need.

## üéØ What We Cover in Flow Friction Discovery

- **Context Alignment**  
  Short pre-work survey and discovery call to gather initial insights about your teams, services, and current challenges.

- **Flow Signals Review**  
  Facilitated walkthrough of flow signals to surface early indicators of friction (e.g., delivery slowdowns, ownership confusion, hidden dependencies).

- **Friction Mapping**  
  Collaborative mapping session to visualize blockers, team interactions, service boundaries, and coordination hotspots.

- **Trigger Identification**  
  Identify where structural or interaction changes might remove friction or accelerate flow.

## üß∞ What You Receive

- Pre-session discovery survey and preparation guide
- 1-day facilitated workshop (remote or in-person)
- Visual friction map (PDF/Miro export)
- Top 3‚Äì5 surfaced flow frictions and potential triggers
- Workshop summary pack with recommended next actions

Optional 30-minute follow-up call to review outcomes

## üìù Outcomes You Can Expect

- Increase shared understanding of blockers across teams and leaders
- Minimize wasted effort diagnosing symptoms instead of root causes
- Accelerate decision-making with clear, visualized evidence
- Reduce misalignment about next steps toward faster flow

## üë• Who Should Attend

We recommend a cross-functional group of 6‚Äì12 participants, typically including:

- Key delivery leads or managers
- Representatives from product, engineering, and operations
- Service owners, architects, or platform leads
- Transformation leaders or flow champions

The workshop works best when it brings together diverse perspectives from across your value streams.
