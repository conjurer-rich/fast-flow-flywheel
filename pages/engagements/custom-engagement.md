## 🛠️ Custom Kickstart + Enablement

Flexible entry, tailored momentum. Build flow your way.

The Custom Kickstart + Enablement engagement offers a right-sized starting point for organizations that want to build initial traction without the commitment of a full Flywheel rotation—plus the flexibility to grow into ongoing enablement based on outcomes and appetite.

We combine a light-touch kickstart to uncover flow signals and early friction points with a clear plan for supporting next steps, including the option for embedded coaching and facilitator enablement.

## 🎯 What We Cover in Custom Kickstart + Enablement

- **Context Alignment**  
  Discovery call to understand your goals, context, and desired outcomes.

- **Signals Radar Assessment**  
  Light-touch sensing across teams and services to capture early indicators of flow friction.

- **Initial Landscape Mapping**  
  A high-level visual map of teams, services, blockers, and coordination patterns.

- **Flow Clinics**  
  1–2 targeted clinics to deep-dive into high-friction areas and co-create actionable Flow Decisions.

- **Draft Flow Roadmap**  
  A Now/Next/Later outline of recommended structural and interaction shifts to build momentum.

- **Reflection and Planning**  
  Follow-up session to review outcomes and shape a tailored enablement plan based on your pace and priorities.
