A focused engagement to align, unblock, and activate your path to faster flow.

![Flywheel Kickstarter](/assets/images/flywheel-kickstarter.png){: .align-center width="30%"}

A Full Rotation of the Flywheel is a high-impact starting point for organizations ready to evolve how they structure teams and services around flow. In this initial engagement, we guide your leaders and teams through the first full rotation of the Fast Flow Flywheel—from sensing to decision-making to strategic alignment and roadmap creation.

This is not a one-time fix. It’s the first turn in a repeatable, value-driving rhythm.

## What We’ll Do

Over the course of 3–6 weeks (or adapted to fit your pace), we’ll co-create the foundations for flow-centric evolution:

{% include feature_row id="kickstarter-steps" %}

## Why This First Turn Matters

The first rotation of the flywheel sets the direction, builds trust in the process, and creates visible momentum. It often requires more investment—strategically and financially—than future cycles. But it lays the foundation for:

- Faster, safer decisions in future rotations
- Cross-team alignment and shared language
- A working model of flow evolution others can replicate

## What You’ll Leave With

- A shared understanding of where you are—and where you want to go
- Visual maps of current boundaries, flow blockers, and user needs
- A set of validated Flow Decisions with rationale and next steps
- A Flow Roadmap to guide future evolution
- Confidence in a lightweight, repeatable approach to org design
- A recommendation for ongoing rhythms to sustain momentum

## Sustaining the Momentum

We recommend running a Flywheel Rotation every 90 days to review signals, make new decisions, and evolve team and service boundaries incrementally.

Our Fast Flow Enabling Team can help you:

- Facilitate future rotations
- Embed flywheel practices across teams
- Upskill internal facilitators and change agents
- Build the muscle for structural evolution at scale

Let’s align, decide, and move forward—together.
