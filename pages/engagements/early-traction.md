A flexible, focused starting point to test the flywheel in action

![Early Traction](/assets/images/engagements/flywheel-kickstart-essentials.png){: .align-center width="300px"}

## Start where you are. Build early traction.

**Early Traction** is a time-boxed engagement designed to help you uncover flow frictions, make meaningful progress on key decisions, and assess the value of the Fast Flow Flywheel‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, without long-term commitment.

If your teams are stuck, misaligned, or weighed down by hidden complexity, but you're unsure where to begin, Early Traction gives you a fast, structured way to sense what's holding you back and act with confidence.

## üåÄ What You‚Äôll Get

A hands-on, collaborative engagement (1‚Äì2 weeks) that includes:

- **Flow Friction Discovery**  
  A structured session to surface and prioritize the signals that flow is breaking down‚Äîdelivery delays, handoff friction, cognitive overload, unclear ownership, and more.

- **Light-touch Landscape Mapping**  
  A quick, high-leverage snapshot of how your teams and services are currently organized, and where the biggest friction points are emerging.

- **One Flow Clinic**  
  A facilitated working session to explore possible causes and co-create actionable Flow Decisions with your teams or leadership group.

- **2‚Äì3 Flow Decisions**  
  Simple, well-reasoned decisions to improve boundaries, ownership, or interactions‚Äîcaptured in a format that‚Äôs easy to share, reflect on, and build from.

- **Draft Flow Roadmap**  
  A Now / Next / Later view of how these early decisions fit together, and what to explore next.
