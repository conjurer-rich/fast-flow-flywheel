A lightweight first turn of the Fast Flow Flywheel

## Start where you are. Move what matters

Kickstart Essentials is a time-boxed engagement designed to help you explore flow problems, make progress on key decisions, and test the value of the Fast Flow Flywheel—without a large upfront commitment.

If your teams are feeling stuck, misaligned, or overburdened—but you’re not sure where to start—Kickstart Essentials gives you a fast, focused way to uncover what's slowing you down and begin evolving with confidence.

## 🌀 What You’ll Get

A hands-on, collaborative engagement (1–2 weeks) that includes:

1. Flow Signals Radar
A structured session to surface and prioritize the signals that suggest flow is breaking down—delivery delays, handoff friction, cognitive overload, unclear ownership, and more.

1. Light-touch Landscape Mapping
A quick, high-leverage view of how your teams and services are currently organized—and where friction is emerging.

1. One Flow Clinic
A facilitated session to explore potential causes and co-create actionable flow decisions with your teams or leadership group.

1. 2–3 Flow Decision Records
Simple, well-reasoned decisions to improve team boundaries, ownership, or interactions—captured in a format that’s easy to share and reflect on.

1. Draft Flow Roadmap
A Now / Next / Later view of how these early decisions fit together—and what to explore next.

## ✅ Outcomes You Can Expect

- Shared language and clarity on what’s getting in the way of flow
- A practical approach to evolve structure without a major reorg
- Real decisions made with visible rationale
- Increased confidence in how to move forward

A sense of momentum—without the overhead of a full transformation

“Kickstart Essentials helped us spot where we were stuck and take action—without waiting for permission to reorg everything.”
— Product Engineering Lead, SaaS Scale-up
