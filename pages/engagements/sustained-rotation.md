## ♻️ Turn your first flywheel rotation into a repeatable rhythm

You’ve taken the first step. You’ve made flow decisions, visualized your roadmap, and started to evolve how your teams work together.

Now it’s time to embed the rhythm.

Sustained Rotation helps your organization build the capability to keep the flywheel turning, quarter after quarter, decision after decision.

This is where faster flow becomes a habit, not a one-time event.

## 🚀 Why Sustained Rotation?

Most organizations don’t fail because they can’t spot problems.
They fail because they don’t know how to act on them, consistently and collaboratively.

Sustained Rotation gives you:

- A cadence of Flow Clinics and Roadmap reviews
- Ongoing guidance to refine boundaries, ownership, and interactions
- Coaching to help internal facilitators and leaders take the wheel
- A culture of structural learning, not structural inertia

## 🔄 What’s Included

A flexible, quarterly rhythm of support tailored to your teams and context. Typically includes:

✅ Quarterly Flywheel Rotations  
✅ Flow Friction Radar updates  
✅ New or evolving Flow Decisions  
✅ Roadmap adjustments and reprioritization  
✅ Reflection sessions to assess what’s working and what’s next

## 🛠️ Facilitator Enablement & Coaching

- Mentoring for internal flow facilitators
- Practical support in leading Flow Clinics and roadmap updates
- Access to toolkits, templates, and decision playbooks

## 📈 Visibility & Progress Tracking

- Support to track the impact of decisions over time
- Signals heatmaps and trend data to inform strategic pivots
- Integration with existing planning or operating rhythms

## 🌱 Community & Capability Building

- Optional participation in a peer network of flow practitioners
- Invitations to live clinics, Q&A sessions, and playbook drops
- Early access to new tools and enhancements from the Faster Flow toolkit

## 📊 What You’ll See Over Time

- Reduced delivery friction and fewer dropped handoffs
- Teams making decisions faster,with less escalation
- Improved clarity of ownership and purpose across services
- Leaders spending less time firefighting, more time guiding

## 👥 Who It’s For

- Teams that want to shift from dependency on consultants to internal capability
- Change agents seeking a repeatable, scalable approach to structural improvement

## 🔧 How It Works

- **Delivery:** Remote or hybrid
- **Cadence:** Quarterly, with monthly check-ins if needed

- **Pricing:** Custom packages based on scope and scale (e.g. from £36k per quarter)
