The **Alignment** element helps ensure that **teams, services, structures, and decisions** remain clearly connected to the **organization’s strategic goals**, user needs, and flow outcomes.

While **Strategy** sets direction and **Flow Decisions** drive change, **Alignment keeps everything coordinated in motion** , enabling fast flow not just once, but continuously.

## ✅ Alignment Enables You To

- **Detect misalignments** through signals and checks before they cause delivery friction  
- **Coordinate across teams and domains** without over-relying on centralized control  
- **Sustain clarity and trust** in how teams are shaped, who owns what, and how decisions are made  
- **Support change** by embedding operational rhythms that reinforce alignment through action  

---

## 🧩 Core Components

- **🧭 Alignment Checks**  
  Questions to assess whether structure, scope, and strategy are truly aligned

- **📡 Alignment Signals**  
  Early warning signs that misalignment is slowing or blocking flow

- **🔁 Alignment Rhythms**  
  Operational cadences and ceremonies to maintain, restore, and reinforce alignment

---

Together, these help teams **navigate complexity**, **respond to change**, and **make flow-conscious decisions** over time , without relying on big-bang reorgs or top-down planning.
