A hands-on guide to unblocking teams, aligning strategy, and accelerating change

Are you navigating team boundaries, structural friction, or flow slowdowns? You're not alone.

That’s why I’m exploring a new book: **Facilitating Fast Flow**, for practitioners who want to turn signals into action and make structural change safer, faster, and more effective.

It will bring together the tools, techniques, and facilitation patterns behind the Fast Flow Flywheel™️, including:

- How to spot early flow signals and uncover hidden blockers
- How to make and test Flow Decisions without triggering a big reorg
- How to use lightweight tools like Flow Clinics, Decision Records, and Playbooks to build momentum
- How to engage leaders, platforms, and teams in evolving structures together

And how to support ongoing learning through reflection, alignment, and amplification

## 👉 Want to see this book happen?

Head over to [facilitatingfastflow.com](https://facilitatingfastflow.com) and add your name. If enough people are interested, I’ll start writing, and you’ll be first to hear when it’s ready.

Let’s build the guide we all wish we had.
