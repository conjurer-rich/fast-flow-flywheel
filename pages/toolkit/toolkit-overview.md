The Fast Flow Toolkit™️ is a collection of principles, heuristics, tactics, patterns and plays to get a Fast Flow Flywheel™️ turning. Built after years of hands-on experience helping organizations adopt Fast Flow, this is a must have for any serious Fast Flow facilitator. The toolkit contains the following elements:
