Meet the Fast Flow Flywheel

> A simple, powerful cycle to help you diagnose, decide, and evolve.


## Why the Flywheel?

Most teams don’t need a big reorg.
They need a way to spot what’s not working, decide what to adjust, and move forward together.

The Fast Flow Flywheel gives you a practical loop for evolving how teams and services are structured—based on real signals, not guesswork.

> It’s not a framework. It’s a rhythm. A way to make progress visible, safe, and aligned.

## The Four-Stage Flywheel

A lightweight, repeatable process for adapting your structure to match the work.

## What’s in the Toolkit?

Practical tools to turn the flywheel:

- **Signals Radar** – Quickly capture where flow is struggling
- **Flow Clinics** – A structured session to prioritize and shape decisions
- **Flow Decision Records (FDRs)** – Simple, lightweight documentation of what’s changing and why
- **Flow Roadmap** – A shared view of what’s happening now, next, and later
- **Plays & Tactics** – Ready-to-use patterns for removing friction and enabling change

No complex frameworks. Just smart tools for faster flow.

## Get Started - Ready to get your flywheel turning?
